						<h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p>
							Project Nimbus website started after we noticed the significant amount of time it took to launch a website for one of our clients. This issue occurred at both the initial launch phase as well as during any deployment process from <span class="code">Dev > Staging > Live</span>. This website aims to democratise the process of website capture and deployment so that Project Managers are able to do staged deploys without requiring dev support.
						</p>
						<h4>My role</h4>
						<p>I was involved in every aspect of the Project Nimbus website, from conception of the overall
							idea, to performing interal stakeholder whiteboard sessions, creating wireframes, prototypes and
							working with the lead developer and project manager  to ensure that the functional requirements were inline with the needs from both a development perspective as well as a project management perspective.
						</p>
						<p>My role consisted of the following:</p>
						<ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
							<li>Research based on stakeholder whiteboard session</li>
							<li>Identification and consolidation of core requirements spec</li>
							<li>Creation of simple user journey diagrams to identify the pain points of developers and project managers</li>
							<li>Development of information architecture</li>
							<li>Creation of low-fidelity wireframes</li>
							<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype</li>
							<li>Creation of full designs, including a design system and component set</li>
							<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
						</ul>

						<section aria-label="summary" class="wide" style="padding-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 20px;">
							<h4>Summary (the TL;DR version)</h4>
							<p>
								Out internal project teams regularly have to screenshot entire websites, including all popups and modal information to create a consolidated PDF that captures the state of the site at the point of approval. This is a legal and compliance issue for our clients and is an absolute requirement of all digital jobs due to the fluidity of development.
							</p>
							<p>
								We focused on evaluating the core problems and created a wishlist that covered versions 1-1.4 based on prioritisation. The intial featureset will include the ability to trigger a screenshot capture of an entire website with all popups triggered and untriggered. It will also show visibly what IP address the site is currently active on so we know when the site hits the live DNS. The project team will also be capable of pushing the sites between Dev, Staging and Live via simple boolean toggles, check off a common pre-launch checklist, see the site's Google Lighthouse usability score, and both run a browser test on common browsers to get a pass/fail response and also create a sitemap via a single click.
							</p>
							<p>
								There's a lot here, but these are all small–medium tasks that we regularly repeat, so creating automated tools to perform these will save countless hours. We estimated that a project manager spends around 6 hours a day completing each of these steps when required. This saving outweighs the initial project build time by many times and was therefore given the greenlight by the management team.
							</p>
							<p>
								This project is a work in progress.

							<h3>Who was it for?</h3>
							<p>The internal project management team
							</p>
							<h3>What challenges did they have?</h3>
							<p> Fundamentally, the challenges were a lack of time.  Our project team are worked to the bone daily and can't allocate the time and resource necessary to complete all of these task manually. The secondary problem is that our internal digital team consists of my myself only and I can't allocate this much spare time for every project. All external development teams are external from the organisation and as such, the cost of performing these tasks regularly is high.
							</p>

							<h3>What might they need?</h3>
							<p> Our team need a large amount of things to get their job done for every major and minor update to a web project.
							</p>
							<p> We discovered the following in our assessment:
								<ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
									<li>Capturing screenshots</li>
									<li>Know what tasks need to be completed at each stage</li>
									<li>Deploy the sites to Dev, Staging and Live</li>
									<li>Show current live IP address</li>
									<li>View a usability score</li>
									<li>Run a browser test</li>
									<li>Create a sitemap</li>
								</ul>

						<h3>What did we do?</h3>
						<p> As stated at the beginning, this is a work in progress so to this point we've only concepted, ideated and laid out some suggested approaches. So we're not much further along than the visuals above at this stage. This is a multi-layered, multi-year project that will take a lot of internal persuasion and buy-in. As with all internal projects, extenal projects will take priority and this is always the case when the team in place is small.
						</p>

						<h4>Platform</h4>
						<p> HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
						</p>
						<h4>Rollout</h4>
						<p> This tool is for internal distribution but is intended to be a project that can be commissioned to other healthcare agencies as they will all suffer from the same issues we face.
