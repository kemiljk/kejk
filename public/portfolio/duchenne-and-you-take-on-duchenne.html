						<h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p>
							Duchenne and You and Take on Duchenne were conceived when our client approached us about
							poorly performing existing Duchenne and You websites and a desire to have healthcare
							professional-specific content online. I worked with the team to analyse the analytics data
							and perform stakeholder interviews to understand the painpoints of using the existing
							website and see what opportunities were available.
						</p>
						<h4>My role</h4>
						<p>I was involved in every aspect of the Duchenne and You/Take on Duchenne project, from
							conception of the overall approach, to performing stakeholder interviews and creating
							wireframes, prototypes and the final user interface. The final interface was then tested
							multiple times with different users and modified to fit their needs.
						</p>
						<p>My role consisted of the following:</p>
						<ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
							<li>In-person interviews/group session</li>
							<li>Planning and paper prototyping</li>
							<li>Development of sitemap and information architecture</li>
							<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype in InVision</li>
							<li>Creation of final UI in Sketch</li>
							<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
							<li>Beta test setup and second round research/feedback</li>
							<li>Some development and regular management of the development team responsible</li>
						</ul>
						</p>

							<h4>Summary (the TL;DR version)</h4>
							<p>
								Alongside the <a href="./duchenne-and-me.html" class="greenSmall">D&Me app</a> project,
								we worked with the same advocates to put together a series of updates to an existing
								parent/carer website (Duchenne and You) as well as develop a partner healthcare
								professional-specific website (Take on Duchenne) that would be more scientific in
								nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								The approach we took was to focus on layering content to hide the scarier information in
								later sections and move detail into layered popups. We did this deliberately based on
								the biggest piece of insight we could receive, that there's an incredibly 1 in 3500
								chance that the person viewing the page has a child with Duchenne, as such, we needed to
								avoid any possibly scaremongering that could occur.
							</p>
							<p>
								The websites have proved equally successful, they have been launched in multiple
								countries globally so far, with Duchenne and You being in 6 countries as well as
								globally in Europe, and Take on Duchenne being live in Europe so far with
								countries-specific versions coming soon.
							</p>
							<p>
								Analytical data shows that generally the average bounce rate is at around 80% which is
								to be expected as the 20% who don't bounce spend at least 5 minutes on site and visit
								around 2-3 pages on average. This is what we expect to see and following additonal
								validation testing, shows that our approach to the UX is successful.
							</p>
							<p>
								The project is still in active development and phase two is currently in rollout phase
								throughout the EU.

							<h3>Who was it for?</h3>
							<p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due
								to a
								defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly.
							</p>

							<p> Resources for parents and healthcare professionals are hard to come by when it comes to
								rare
								disease and our client saw a need for providing a wealth of information to both
								audiences.
							</p>

							<h3>What challenges did they have?</h3>
							<p> One of the biggest factors we were made aware of through parent interviews was the
								rarity of
								the disease and the likelihood that a child didn’t have Duchenne. The worry, is that
								it’s
								easy as a frightened parent of a young child displaying normal symptoms of slow
								development
								to see Duchenne as a possible answer and be terrified at seeing their child will die
								young.
								This potential scaremongering is something our client wished to avoid at all costs.
							</p>
							<p>
								Online resources all came traditionally from credible charities and support groups, but
								our client saw an opportunity to offer their own take on the necessary information that
								would be valuable to parents and carers of children with Duchenne. Most importantly,
								they wanted to highlight the rarity of the condition and ensure there wasn't a spike in
								misdiagnoses.
							</p>
							<p> Healthcare professionals on the other hand struggled with a lack of high-science
								information
								for them to read and understand. A GP will likely never see a case in their lifetime but
								if
								they did, they’d need ample resource to help them. The current offering for healthcare
								professionals is limited to the same resources that parents and carers can utilise. This
								means that the information is highly simplified and focused on the day to day struggles
								of living with the condition and less about the scienece of treatment.
							</p>

							<h3>What might they need?</h3>
							<p> The conversations led us to believe that a platform needed to exist online with parent
								and
								HCP-friendly information on it. It needed to focus heavily on showing only the most
								important and relevant information to someone when they needed it.
							</p>
							<p> We had multiple stakeholder interview sessions throughout the course of prototyping the
								website structure and concepts, and one thing we always came back to was the importance
								of not eliciting fear. We explored several structures based on this but always came back
								to the idea of layering content. By separating the 'need to know' information with the
								'want to know', we were able to present enough information to a parent or carer without
								scaring them with the long-term outcomes of the disease. This meant that a parent or
								carer could slowly piece together the information they wanted and needed over time,
								rather than being blasted with the worst possible information immediately.

							<h3>What did we do?</h3>
							<p> The outcome was a pair of websites that had a shared information architecture and
								interface
								paradigm. They leveraged a collapsed nav by default at all screen sizes (to reduce the
								urge
								to skip to the “worst case scenario”), deeper content hidden behind pop ups that are
								also
								bullet points and section footers that encouraged moving to the next section when they’d
								read the whole site (thus confirming the content was still relevant).
							</p>
							<p>
								Initial rollout consisted of pushing the core European website live, this was an
								English-language website that featured content relevant to all stakeholders. Due to
								regulation requirements in Pharmaceuticals, we had to auto-redirect UK users away from
								this site which required research into and implementation of an IP-redirection function.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once we started to see some success with the new numbers for the European website (the
								audience size was growing by around 20% month to month) the client wanted to begin
								implementing local-language Duchenne and You versions too. This led to the development
								of the US website (where regulations are very different and user numbers were beyond
								impressive at 6000 monthly visitors) and further Spanish, German, French and Portuguese
								websites. We're also currently developing Greek,Swedish, Hebrew, Turkish and Arabic
								versions, as well as a dedicated UK website.
							</p>
							<p>
								Take on Duchenne was a different story as it is far more complicated under regulations
								to get healthcare information approved and live, this is why the European site is the
								only live website at the moment. The UK version is likely to go live shortly alongside a
								Portuguese and Turkish one.

							<h4>Challenges</h4>
							<p>
								Post-rollout of the European version, our client had a change of heart. They wished to
								change the core navigation structure of the website against our recommendations.
								Unfortunately, this was due to a personal belief on our client's side that opening up
								the navigation by default and including sub-navigation items would lead to a better
								experience. Sadly, despite regular pushback based on user research and direct input from
								caregivers, we were required to change this.
							</p>
							<p>
								The reason for the change was that the client didn't like the amount of traffic or the
								time spent on site from our analytics. They felt that this was because users struggled
								to know where to go when on the website despite our user research showing that it was in
								fact because the front page gave them enough information to decide that Duchenne <i>was
									not</i> what their child had which was our goal all along.
							</p>
							<p>
								I found it incredibly hard to deal with this process. This project was my shining star
								at the time and all I wanted was to do right by the users and ensure they had a pleasant
								experience using the website and got what they needed not what we wanted to show them.
								Since making the change, we've seen no noticeable increase in traffice or time on site,
								thus verifying our beliefs. Despite showing all of the evidence, some times it's
								incredibly hard to take a client away from thinking about <i>their</i> experience and
								beliefs, versus what the end user <i>actually wants</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								We're continuing to push our client to revert to the original navigation style and focus
								on making decisions based on actionable user research, but I have a feeling it's going
								to be an ongoing struggle.
							</p>

							<h4>Platform</h4>
							<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP backed by the Wordpress CMS.
							</p>

							<h4>Rollout</h4>
							<p>Duchenne and You is currently live in Europe, the US, Spain, Germany, France, Latin
								America and Portugal. Take on Duchenne is currently live in Europe.
