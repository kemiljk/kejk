							<h3>WHO WAS IT FOR?</h3>
							<p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due to a
								defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly.
							</p>

							<p> Resources for parents and healthcare professionals are hard to come by when it comes to rare
								disease and our client saw a need for providing a wealth of information to both audiences.
							</p>

							<h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
							<p> One of the biggest factors we were made aware of through parent interviews was the rarity of
								the disease and the likelihood that a child didn’t have Duchenne. The worry, is that it’s
								easy as a frightened parent of a young child displaying normal symptoms of slow development
								to see Duchenne as a possible answer and be terrified at seeing their child will die young.
								This potential scaremongering is something our client wished to avoid at all costs.
							</p>
							<p>
								Online resources all came traditionally from credible charities and support groups, but our client saw an opportunity to offer their own take on the necessary information that would be valuable to parents and carers of children with Duchenne. Most importantly, they wanted to highlight the rarity of the condition and ensure there wasn't a spike in misdiagnoses.
							</p>
							<p> Healthcare professionals on the other hand struggled with a lack of high-science information
								for them to read and understand. A GP will likely never see a case in their lifetime but if
								they did, they’d need ample resource to help them. The current offering for healthcare professionals is limited to the same resources that parents and carers can utilise. This means that the information is highly simplified and focused on the day to day struggles of living with the condition and less about the scienece of treatment.
							</p>

							<h3>WHAT MIGHT THEY NEED?</h3>
							<p> The conversations led us to believe that a platform needed to exist online with parent and
								HCP-friendly information on it. It needed to focus heavily on showing only the most
								important and relevant information to someone when they needed it.
							</p>
							<p> We had multiple stakeholder interview sessions throughout the course of prototyping the website structure and concepts, and one thing we always came back to was the importance of not eliciting fear. We explored several structures based on this but always came back to the idea of layering content. By separating the 'need to know' information with the 'want to know', we were able to present enough information to a parent or carer without scaring them with the long-term outcomes of the disease. This meant that a parent or carer could slowly piece together the information they wanted and needed over time, rather than being blasted with the worst possible information immediately.

							<h3>WHAT DID WE DO?</h3>
							<p> The outcome was a pair of websites that had a shared information architecture and interface
								paradigm. They leveraged a collapsed nav by default at all screen sizes (to reduce the urge
								to skip to the “worst case scenario”), deeper content hidden behind pop ups that are also
								bullet points and section footers that encouraged moving to the next section when they’d
								read the whole site (thus confirming the content was still relevant).
							</p>
							<p>
								Initial rollout consisted of pushing the core European website live, this was an English-language website that featured content relevant to all stakeholders. Due to regulation requirements in Pharmaceuticals, we had to auto-redirect UK users away from this site which required research into and implementation of an IP-redirection function. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Once we started to see some success with the new numbers for the European website (the audience size was growing by around 20% month to month) the client wanted to begin implementing local-language Duchenne and You versions too. This led to the development of the US website (where regulations are very different and user numbers were beyond impressive at 6000 monthly visitors) and further Spanish, German, French and Portuguese websites. We're also currently developing Greek,Swedish, Hebrew, Turkish and Arabic versions, as well as a dedicated UK website. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Take on Duchenne was a different story as it is far more complicated under regulations to get healthcare information approved and live, this is why the European site is the only live website at the moment. The UK version is likely to go live shortly alongside a Portuguese and Turkish one.

							<h4>CHALLENGES</h4>
							<p>
								Post-rollout of the European version, our client had a change of heart. They wished to change the core navigation structure of the website against our recommendations. Unfortunately, this was due to a personal belief on our client's side that opening up the navigation by default and including sub-navigation items would lead to a better experience. Sadly, despite regular pushback based on user research and direct input from caregivers, we were required to change this. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The reason for the change was that the client didn't like the amount of traffic or the time spent on site from our analytics. They felt that this was because users struggled to know where to go when on the website despite our user research showing that it was in fact because the front page gave them enough information to decide that Duchenne <i>was not</i> what their child had which was our goal all along.
							</p>
							<p>
								I found it incredibly hard to deal with this process. This project was my shining star at the time and all I wanted was to do right by the users and ensure they had a pleasant experience using the website and got what they needed not what we wanted to show them. Since making the change, we've seen no noticeable increase in traffice or time on site, thus verifying our beliefs. Despite showing all of the evidence, some times it's incredibly hard to take a client away from thinking about <i>their</i> experience and beliefs, versus what the end user <i>actually wants</i>.
							</p>
							<p>
								We're continuing to push our client to revert to the original navigation style and focus on making decisions based on actionable user research, but I have a feeling it's going to be an ongoing struggle.
							</p>
