							<h3>What is it?</h3>
							<p>
								DyeD was conceived when our client approached us about wanting to improve the management of dry eye disease, especially with non-expert healthcare professionals who don't have the same level of expensive equipment that the expert centres do. Dry eye disease is a life altering condition but it benefits from a very fast response to treatment when caught.
							</p>
							<h4>My role</h4>
							<p>I was involved in many aspects of the DyeD project, from conception of technology and interface, through to defining the machine learning model and interface for the app.
							</p>
							<p>
							My role consisted of the following:
								<ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
									<li>Skype-based interviews</li>
									<li>Development of sitemap and information architecture</li>
									<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype</li>
									<li>Conception and delivery of iconography and interface</li>
									<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
									<li>Vision for phase 2</li>
									<li>Alpha and beta test guides and research script writing</li>
									<li>Expert interviews to evaluate stakeholder feedback</li>
								</ul>

							<h3>Who was it for?</h3>
							<p> Key opinion leaders who are experts in diagnosing dry eye disease.
							</p>

							<h3>What challenges did they have?</h3>
							<p> Keratitis (dry eye disease) is very rare but extremely progressive. Currently, general
								practitioners struggle to diagnose the severity early enough and monitor that progression over time.
								As a result, patients are diagnosed too late or rarely improve.
							</p>
							<p style="margin-bottom:20px;"> Current methods involve reviewing physical symptoms based on both experience and a paper chart
								called the Oxford Rating Scale. Both of these methods are only as effective as the doctor's
								experience and as such often lead to misdiagnoses and lack of accurate progression tracking.

							<h3>What might they need?</h3>
							<p> A tool to help support correct diagnoses for these non-expert audiences. The experts are comfortable
								in diagnoses but they aren't always consulted by GPs when diagnoses are carried out. There have been
								several papers testing out the idea of a machine learning algorithm that can detect the condition by
								counting the visual coverage of the abrasions on the eye. This validated the approach of building a
								standalone application for dry eye disease as a first-to-market product.
							</p>
							<p> A fluorescent dye is placed in the patient's eye and these are then photographed under UV light to
								see the extent of the abrasions. The end result is an image that can be compared against pre-scored
								expert examples in a database of images.

							<h3>What did we do?</h3>
							<p> We built a prototype for an application that can take images of an eye using a
								smartphone camera and compare the severity of the condition against a database of
								previously scored images. The expert can then either approve the machine score or assign
								a new score. The tool was decided to be an application for smartphones and tablets (some
								level of scalability) and is planned to evolve to eventually have Class I medical device
								status so it’s able to preemptively diagnose based on imaging.

								<h3>UI explorations</h3>

								<p><strong>App Icons</strong></p>
								<p>
									App icon exploration took shape relatively quickly and started with the most obvious thought of using the outline of an eye encased in the camera app's focus ring. I always like to explore the most obvious idea I have first an then take time to abstract away the idea line by line to see what results can form. Often, I find that by taking lines away, the focus switches to suggestion rather than description of the symbol and it can make for a more pleasing and unique marque.
								</p>
								<p>
									I then explored the idea of a more dimensional icon. Something that was able to be abstract but without losing character or personality. The icons all rotated around the colour of the fluorescent dye green on a dark background based on our client's dark blue colour.
								</p>
								<p>
									The final icon was formed from an abstraction of an idea that mimicked our client's company name which begins with an 'S'. I stripped away the top half and introduced an outline approach to the top eye lid. I then introduced a pupil. When all of the pieces were put together, it created both an eye outline as well as an appearance of a sun rising from behind a field. This was intentional, as the sunrise represents the dawn of a new day and for these patients, getting correctly graded and put onto the right treatment leads to better outcomes and a new life without severe eye iritation.
								</p>

								</section>

								<p><strong>User interface</strong></p>
								<p>
									From the beginning I wanted to have both a light and dark theme due to both Android and iOS featuring these options by default in 2019. I started with the dark theme and wanted to rotate around the idea of the client's brand's dark blue rather than a traditional black. I felt that by doing this the app would have a unique quality and stand out against traditional black interfaces.
								</p>
								<p>
									The overall interface is incredibly minimal and simple. This app has single-minded proposition; to improve the lives of patients suffering with severe dry eye disease. This is achieved through capturing images of patient eyes, grading them against the industry recognised Oxford Rating Scale and then attributing this to an existing or new patient with the option to add notes where necessary. I decided to focus on large type, simple iconography and clean backgrounds. 
								</p>
								<p>
									At this point, this is a work in progress and is still to be agreed by the client. 
								</p>
								<h4>Final interface ideas</h4>

							<h4>Platform</h4>
							<p> React or Vue for iOS and Android.
							</p>
							<h4>Rollout</h4>
							<p> This tool will be globally released for all medical professionals following an alpha and beta test period with
								key experts.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Phase 2 – Machine Learning</strong></p>
							<p>
								The goal with the app is to quietly use machine learning in the background to capture and store the physician gradings using hashing and anonymisation of user data to store just the image and grade without any of the associated user data. This allows us to begin building the machine learning model from day one of our alpha tests without needing lots of pre-graded data sets and also ensures that the model is able to work with the types of images our physicians capture in the real world versus using complex images captured with professional equipment. The model will need to work with a variety of different light sources and across a wide spectrum of use cases.
							</p>
							<p>
								The model will utilise pixel mapping to compare images to each other and then match this against the grade they've been assigned. By counting the number of green pixels, the model will be able to compare total volume of pixels against the grade that's been assigned and in the future begin to offer predictive results based on counting the volume.
							</p>
							<p>
								The model will be locally stored on a device and will only send and receive the hashed data when necessary to prevent sharing of unnecessary or unintentional data. By keeping the model on-device, we're also able to ensure fast comparisons of datasets and no need for network access (parsed information can be shared back to the cloud dataset when the device makes a connection).
