							<h3>WHO WAS IT FOR?</h3>
							<p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due to a
								defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly.
							</p>

							<p> Resources for parents and healthcare professionals are hard to come by when it comes to rare
								disease and our client saw a need for providing a wealth of information to both audiences.
							</p>

							<h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
							<p> One of the biggest factors we were made aware of through parent interviews was the rarity of
								the disease and the likelihood that a child didn’t have Duchenne. The worry, is that it’s
								easy as a frightened parent of a young child displaying normal symptoms of slow development
								to see Duchenne as a possible answer and be terrified at seeing their child will die young.
								This potential scaremongering is something our client wished to avoid at all costs.
							</p>
							<p>
								Online resources all came traditionally from credible charities and support groups, but our client saw an opportunity to offer their own take on the necessary information that would be valuable to parents and carers of children with Duchenne. Most importantly, they wanted to highlight the rarity of the condition and ensure there wasn't a spike in misdiagnoses.
							</p>
							<p> Healthcare professionals on the other hand struggled with a lack of high-science information
								for them to read and understand. A GP will likely never see a case in their lifetime but if
								they did, they’d need ample resource to help them. The current offering for healthcare professionals is limited to the same resources that parents and carers can utilise. This means that the information is highly simplified and focused on the day to day struggles of living with the condition and less about the scienece of treatment.
							</p>

							<h3>WHAT MIGHT THEY NEED?</h3>
							<p> The conversations led us to believe that a platform needed to exist online with parent and
								HCP-friendly information on it. It needed to focus heavily on showing only the most
								important and relevant information to someone when they needed it.
							</p>
							<p> We had multiple stakeholder interview sessions throughout the course of prototyping the website structure and concepts, and one thing we always came back to was the importance of not eliciting fear. We explored several structures based on this but always came back to the idea of layering content. By separating the 'need to know' information with the 'want to know', we were able to present enough information to a parent or carer without scaring them with the long-term outcomes of the disease. This meant that a parent or carer could slowly piece together the information they wanted and needed over time, rather than being blasted with the worst possible information immediately.

							<h3>WHAT DID WE DO?</h3>
							<p> The outcome was a pair of websites that had a shared information architecture and interface
								paradigm. They leveraged a collapsed nav by default at all screen sizes (to reduce the urge
								to skip to the “worst case scenario”), deeper content hidden behind pop ups that are also
								bullet points and section footers that encouraged moving to the next section when they’d
								read the whole site (thus confirming the content was still relevant).
							</p>

							<h4>Platform</h4>
							<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP hosted through Wordpress.
							</p>

							<h4>Rollout</h4>
							<p>Duchenne and You is currently live in Europe, the US, Spain, Germany, France and Portugal. Take on Duchenne
								is currently live in Europe.
							</p>
							<h4>My role</h4>
							<p>We were a small team when we started the website projects so my roles covered most areas:
								<ul>
									<li>In-person interviews/group session</li>
									<li>Planning and paper prototyping</li>
									<li>Development of sitemap and information architecture</li>
									<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype in InVision</li>
									<li>Creation of final UI in Sketch</li>
									<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
									<li>Beta test setup and second round research/feedback</li>
									<li>Some development</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
