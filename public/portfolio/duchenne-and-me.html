			<h3>WHO WAS IT FOR?</h3>
			<p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due
				to a
				defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly. As a result,
				muscle
				tissue turns to fat and often the child only lives until their mid-20’s. These
				children, due to their
				restrictions, are often very computer savvy and tend to love playing video games and
				using
				computers.
			</p>

			<p> The other side of the coin is the parents and carers of these children. Although not
				directly
				affected by the condition, they are tasked with managing the day to day condition for
				the child
				and tend to struggle to do so.
			</p>
			<h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
			<p> From research we conducted with parents and carers, we found overwhelmingly that
				100% of them struggled to remember to track vital statistics about their child
				(growth, weight gain, activity levels) and remember to provide them with the correct
				doses of their medications at the right times (often the mid-day dose was most
				challenging to remember). Secondly, they struggle in emergency situations such as
				visiting A&E. The condition is so rare that most emergency staff never see a case
				and as such aren’t aware of specific difficulties such as easy fracturing of bones
				or limited lung capacity when put on ventilators.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the biggest problems for the parents and carers is that they had many different ways to track and record information. Healthcare providers offered paper-based forms and leaflets for the parent to hand to emergency staff as required but in a panic situation like this, it's unlikely that they'll remember to bring this.
			</p>
			<p>
				When it came to tracking important information, parents varied in what they did but most often they'd either just not write anything down, note it into their phone or, in one case, use an excel spreadsheet to track this information to share with their doctor.
			</p>
			<h3>WHAT MIGHT THEY NEED?</h3>
			<p> All parents in our research group agreed that some kind of application was ideal for
				keeping on top of things both in and out of the home. As they, and their children,
				used smart devices regularly it made sense to go to where they already are. We
				needed to ensure that whatever we built was cross-platform and worked across a
				wide-range of devices due to the need to deliver across many countries worldwide.

			<h3>WHAT DID WE DO?</h3>
			<p> Following research and sharing of paper prototypes, we found the sweet spot for the
				child and parent/carer’s needs was to have sections for the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Dashboard (for showing key child statistics)</li>
					<li>Schedule (with pre- and post-appointment reminders/notes)</li>
					<li>Emergency care considerations (for A&E situations)</li>
					<li>Medication (for reminders and accurate dosing)</li>
					<li>Help (for frequently asked questions, delivered as a sql-based chat bot)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We worked extremely closely with one stakeholder throughout the entire journey of the app. As a parent of a child with Duchenne, a person with experience in the tech industry and patient advocate running one of the disease awareness websites, he was an ideal person to have on board.
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout the process, he helped us to ensure we were always keeping the child and carers best interest at heart. It could have been very easy to lose site (a first prototype involved AR overlays to encourage the child to complete walking tests but this ultimately proved to be overkill and unnecessary) but working with our advocate meant we could stick to what was most important.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, when we finally delivered the app his feedback was glowing and in direct conversation with the client he stressed his love of it, his desire to continue to support us into V2 and beyond and that he believed this app added value beyond just Duchenne.
				</p>
				<h4>Platform</h4>
				<p>In order to deliver something scalable and cross-platform we opted for an app that
					we could deploy through Appcelerator to iOS and Android. This meant we needed to focus on JavaScript
					as our main language of choice and use JSON and XML to handle language
					translations.
				</p>
				<h4>CHALLENGES</h4>
				<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
				<p>
					Our initial version 1 rollout was a major challenge. Due to the size of our company, we were required to outsource the development work and as such trusted our supplier to guide us on technologies. We needed a true cross-platform approach and thus required a language that scaled both. The suggestion from our supplier was to build in Lua, a lesser known gaming language that can be compiled into phone apps via Cordova. Due to the time constraints and trust, we went with their recommendation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, I ended up having to learn the basics of the language to help support in delivery due to the time pressure we were under and the under-resourcing of our supplier. We didn't have the budget for more people so it was up to me to learn additional coding skills to be able to make minor adjustments to production code in order to deliver on time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately, the app did compile via Cordova, work, and get approved across the iOS and Google Play stores with a day to spare before launch. As this was being launched at our client's patient advocacy conference, the hard deadline was not moveable. It also coincided with Rare Disease Day which gave our client the opportunity to push for press releases and major announcements in the world of pharmaceuticals and rare disease.
				</p>

				<p><strong>A sql problem</strong></p>
				<p>
					When it came to migrating to version 2 we realised a very serious problem right at the end of the process. We'd had to move suppliers due to the previous headache and were building this new version in JavaScript and compiling via Appcelerator. Overall, the app was much faster, more dynamic and had been given a nice visual facelift.
				</p>
				<p>
					We noticed during final testing however, that we had a problem with migration. Each existing user would need to update to version 2, but version 2 was built in an entirely different way with a differently structured sql database and some new features. And we weren't entirely sure what would happen when a user chose to update.
				</p>
				<p>
					After lots of discussion and stress, we realised that we could re-upload version 1 to TestFlight and force a migration to version 2 through there on test devices, guaranteeing what a user would be able to pull across safely.
				</p>
				<p>
					After days of testing and interation, we finally got a version to work correctly and pull all important data through. This meant we were ready to push version 2 live and could do this on time for the next most important day in a Duchenne team's calendar, World Duchenne Awareness Day.
				</p>
				<h4>Rollout</h4>
				<p>Duchenne and Me is currently live in 4 countries; the UK, Germany, Greece and Turkey, and
					is due to go live in several other countries in the coming months. Reception so far
					has been excellent and app retention remains at around 83%.
				</p>
				<h4>My role</h4>
				<p>We were a small team when we started the app project so my roles covered most areas:
					<ul>
						<li>In-person interviews/group session</li>
						<li>Planning and paper prototyping</li>
						<li>Development of sitemap and information architecture</li>
						<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype in InVision</li>
						<li>Creation of final UI in Sketch</li>
						<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
						<li>Beta test setup and second round research/feedback</li>
						<li>Some minor development</li>
					</ul>
