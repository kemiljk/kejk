						<h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p>
							Duchenne and Me is an app for parents, carers and patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,
							a debilitating and fatal muscle wastage disease. Duchenne and Me was developed to help
							manage the day to day challenges of living with Duchenne from both patient and carer
							perspectives. It is a one-of-a-kind product, tailored specifically, but not exclusively, to
							Duchenne.
						</p>
						<h4>My role</h4>
						<p>We were a small team when we started the app project so I had to be flexible in how I
							supported the wider team. My involvement covered a wide spectrum from research, wireframing
							and prototyping, through to the final information architecture, user interface and
							management of rollout. We performed significant user testing throughout, working closely
							with one particular parent of a child with Duchenne and made major revisions to the
							interface based on this continuous feedback.
						</p>
						<p>
							My role consisted of the following:
							<ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
								<li>In-person interviews/group session</li>
								<li>Planning and paper prototyping</li>
								<li>Development of sitemap and information architecture</li>
								<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype in InVision</li>
								<li>Creation of final UI in Sketch</li>
								<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
								<li>Beta test setup and second round research/feedback</li>
								<li>Some minor development</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<section aria-label="summary" class="wide" style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
							<h4>Summary (the TL;DR version)</h4>
							<p>
								Following an approach from our client about creating something that would provide a
								service to medicine, we ran a workshop with key advocates in the Duchenne field to
								identify the potential needs of a tool to help in their day to day experiences.
							</p>
							<p>
								The research led to the idea of an app which we ideated in the session via paper
								prototypes (you can find these below) and subsequently drew up a development plan that
								we used to inform the relevant project phases moving forwards.
							</p>
							<p>
								The app we created was a huge success despite several challenging moments throughout its
								process (almost resulting in it not going live in time for Rare Disease Day!) and has
								gone on to receive commendation for its value by the PM Society's digital product
								committee and industry experts.
							</p>
							<p>
								From overseeing analytics from phase one into phase two, we can see that app retention
								rates are at around 83% on average and we continue to receive positive reviews from
								nurses and doctors who've shared the app with their patients.
							</p>
							<p>
								The project is still in active development and phase two is currently in rollout phase
								throughout the EU.

						<section aria-label="content">
							<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
							<p> Duchenne is an extremely rare disease affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due
								to a
								defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly. As a result,
								muscle
								tissue turns to fat and often the child only lives until their mid-20’s. These
								children, due to their
								restrictions, are often very computer savvy and tend to love playing video games and
								using
								computers.
							</p>

							<p> The other side of the coin is the parents and carers of these children. Although not
								directly
								affected by the condition, they are tasked with managing the day to day condition for
								the child
								and tend to struggle to do so.
							</p>
							<h3>What challenges did they have?</h3>
							<p> From research we conducted with parents and carers, we found overwhelmingly that
								100% of them struggled to remember to track vital statistics about their child
								(growth, weight gain, activity levels) and remember to provide them with the correct
								doses of their medications at the right times (often the mid-day dose was most
								challenging to remember). Secondly, they struggle in emergency situations such as
								visiting A&E. The condition is so rare that most emergency staff never see a case
								and as such aren’t aware of specific difficulties such as easy fracturing of bones
								or limited lung capacity when put on ventilators.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the biggest problems for the parents and carers is that they had many different
								ways to track and record information. Healthcare providers offered paper-based forms and
								leaflets for the parent to hand to emergency staff as required but in a panic situation
								like this, it's unlikely that they'll remember to bring this.
							</p>
							<p>
								When it came to tracking important information, parents varied in what they did but most
								often they'd either just not write anything down, note it into their phone or, in one
								case, use an excel spreadsheet to track this information to share with their doctor.
							</p>
							<p> We discovered the following in our assessment:
								<ul class="list-display list-cross">
									<li>No single tool existed to support patients, parents or carers</li>
									<li>Research showed a single app in the market focused on emergency situations and
										another focused on news in treatment development</li>
									<li>The interfaces were not particularly user friendly and didn't account for the
										true needs of the user</li>
									<li>The apps were rarely, if ever, updated</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<h3>What might they need?</h3>
							<p> All parents in our research group agreed that some kind of application was ideal for
								keeping on top of things both in and out of the home. As they, and their children,
								used smart devices regularly it made sense to go to where they already are. We
								needed to ensure that whatever we built was cross-platform and worked across a
								wide-range of devices due to the need to deliver across many countries worldwide.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section aria-label="content">
							<h3>What did we do?</h3>
							<p> Following research and sharing of paper prototypes, we found the sweet spot for the
								child and parent/carer’s needs was to have sections for the following:
								<ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
									<li>Dashboard (for showing key child statistics)</li>
									<li>Schedule (with pre- and post-appointment reminders/notes)</li>
									<li>Emergency care considerations (for A&E situations)</li>
									<li>Medication (for reminders and accurate dosing)</li>
									<li>Help (for frequently asked questions, delivered as a sql-based chat bot)</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									We worked extremely closely with one stakeholder throughout the entire journey of
									the app. As a parent of a child with Duchenne, a person with experience in the tech
									industry and patient advocate running one of the disease awareness websites, he was
									an ideal person to have on board.
								</p>
								<p>
									Throughout the process, he helped us to ensure we were always keeping the child and
									carers best interest at heart. It could have been very easy to lose site (a first
									prototype involved AR overlays to encourage the child to complete walking tests but
									this ultimately proved to be overkill and unnecessary) but working with our advocate
									meant we could stick to what was most important.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ultimately, when we finally delivered the app his feedback was glowing and in direct
									conversation with the client he stressed his love of it, his desire to continue to
									support us into V2 and beyond and that he believed this app added value beyond just
									Duchenne.

									<h4>Platform</h4>
									<p>In order to deliver something scalable and cross-platform we opted for an app
										that
										we could deploy through Appcelerator to iOS and Android. This meant we needed to
										focus on JavaScript
										as our main language of choice and use JSON and XML to handle language
										translations.
									</p>
									<a href="https://www.actionduchenne.org/ptc-therapeutics-marks-rare-disease-day-2018-with-duchenne-and-me-app/"
										target="_new" class="post" style="margin-top:20px" alt="press release">Initial
										press release</a>

									<h4 style="margin-top:40px;">CHALLENGES</h4>
									<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
									<p>
										Our initial version 1 rollout was a major challenge. Due to the size of our
										company, we were required to outsource the development work and as such trusted
										our supplier to guide us on technologies. We needed a true cross-platform
										approach and thus required a language that scaled both. The suggestion from our
										supplier was to build in Lua, a lesser known gaming language that can be
										compiled into phone apps via Cordova. Due to the time constraints and trust, we
										went with their recommendation.
									</p>
									<p>
										Ultimately, I ended up having to learn the basics of the language to help
										support in delivery due to the time pressure we were under and the
										under-resourcing of our supplier. We didn't have the budget for more people so
										it was up to me to learn additional coding skills to be able to make minor
										adjustments to production code in order to deliver on time.
									</p>
									<p>
										Fortunately, the app did compile via Cordova, work, and get approved across the
										iOS and Google Play stores with a day to spare before launch. As this was being
										launched at our client's patient advocacy conference, the hard deadline was not
										moveable. It also coincided with Rare Disease Day which gave our client the
										opportunity to push for press releases and major announcements in the world of
										pharmaceuticals and rare disease.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section aria-label="version 1 problems" style="margin-top:10px;">

									<p><strong>A sql problem</strong></p>
									<p>
										When it came to migrating to version 2 we realised a very serious problem right
										at the end of the process. We'd had to move suppliers due to the previous
										headache and were building this new version in JavaScript and compiling via
										Appcelerator. Overall, the app was much faster, more dynamic and had been given
										a nice visual facelift.
									</p>
									<p>
										We noticed during final testing however, that we had a problem with migration.
										Each existing user would need to update to version 2, but version 2 was built in
										an entirely different way with a differently structured sql database and some
										new features. And we weren't entirely sure what would happen when a user chose
										to update.
									</p>
									<p>
										After lots of discussion and stress, we realised that we could re-upload version
										1 to TestFlight and force a migration to version 2 through there on test
										devices, guaranteeing what a user would be able to pull across safely.
									</p>
									<p>
										After days of testing and iteration, we finally got a version to work correctly
										and pull all important data through. This meant we were ready to push version 2
										live and could do this on time for the next most important day in a Duchenne
										team's calendar, World Duchenne Awareness Day.
									</p>
									<h4>Rollout</h4>
									<p>Duchenne and Me is currently live in 4 countries; the UK, Germany, Greece and
										Turkey, and
										is due to go live in several other countries in the coming months. Reception so
										far
										has been excellent and app retention remains at around 83%.
									</p>

									<h4 style="margin-top:40px;">THE FUTURE – Version 3</h4>
									<p>
										I've recently started the initial explorations of what version 3 of the app
										could be. I've been working on
										simplifying the navigation system so that it focuses on the core needs of the
										user instead of overloading the bottom
										navigation with content.
									</p>
									<p>
										These changes are based on the latest round of feedback from our core user base
										and are a work in progress.
