                                <h3>WHO WAS IT FOR?</h3>
                                <p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due
                                    to a
                                    defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly. As a result,
                                    muscle
                                    tissue turns to fat and often the child only lives until their mid-20’s. These
                                    children, due to their
                                    restrictions, are often very computer savvy and tend to love playing video games and
                                    using
                                    computers.
                                </p>

                                <p> The other side of the coin is the parents and carers of these children. Although not
                                    directly
                                    affected by the condition, they are tasked with managing the day to day condition for
                                    the child
                                    and tend to struggle to do so.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="post">
                                <h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
                                <p> From research we conducted with parents and carers, we found overwhelmingly that
                                    100% of them struggled to remember to track vital statistics about their child
                                    (growth, weight gain, activity levels) and remember to provide them with the correct
                                    doses of their medications at the right times (often the mid-day dose was most
                                    challenging to remember). Secondly, they struggle in emergency situations such as
                                    visiting A&E. The condition is so rare that most emergency staff never see a case
                                    and as such aren’t aware of specific difficulties such as easy fracturing of bones
                                    or limited lung capacity when put on ventilators.
                                </p>

                                <h3>WHAT MIGHT THEY NEED?</h3>
                                <p> All parents in our research group agreed that some kind of application was ideal for
                                    keeping on top of things both in and out of the home. As they, and their children,
                                    used smart devices regularly it made sense to go to where they already are. We
                                    needed to ensure that whatever we built was cross-platform and worked across a
                                    wide-range of devices due to the need to deliver across many countries worldwide.
                                </p>

                                 <h3>WHAT DID WE DO?</h3>
                                 <p> Following research and sharing of paper prototypes, we found the sweet spot for the
                                     child and parent/carer’s needs was to have sections for the following:
                                     <ul>
                                        <li>Dashboard (for showing key child statistics)</li>
                                        <li>Schedule (with pre- and post-appointment reminders/notes)</li>
                                        <li>Emergency care considerations (for A&E situations)</li>
                                        <li>Medication (for reminders and accurate dosing)</li>
                                        <li>Help (for frequently asked questions, delivered as a sql-based chat bot)</li>
                                     </ul>
                                <h4>Platform</h4>
                                <p>In order to deliver something scalable and cross-platform we opted for an app that
                                     we could deploy through Appcelerator. This meant we needed to focus on JavaScript
                                     as our main language of choice and use JSON and XML to handle language
                                     translations.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Rollout</h4>
                                <p>Duchenne and Me is currently live in 3 countries; the UK, Germany and Turkey, and
                                     is due to go live in several other countries in the coming months. Reception so far
                                     has been excellent and app retention remains at around 83%.
                                </p>
