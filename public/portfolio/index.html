                                <h3>WHO WAS IT FOR?</h3>
                                <p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due
                                    to a
                                    defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly. As a result,
                                    muscle
                                    tissue turns to fat and often the child only lives until their mid-20’s. These
                                    children, due to their
                                    restrictions, are often very computer savvy and tend to love playing video games and
                                    using
                                    computers.
                                </p>

                                <p> The other side of the coin is the parents and carers of these children. Although not
                                    directly
                                    affected by the condition, they are tasked with managing the day to day condition for
                                    the child
                                    and tend to struggle to do so.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
                                <p> From research we conducted with parents and carers, we found overwhelmingly that
                                    100% of them struggled to remember to track vital statistics about their child
                                    (growth, weight gain, activity levels) and remember to provide them with the correct
                                    doses of their medications at the right times (often the mid-day dose was most
                                    challenging to remember). Secondly, they struggle in emergency situations such as
                                    visiting A&E. The condition is so rare that most emergency staff never see a case
                                    and as such aren’t aware of specific difficulties such as easy fracturing of bones
                                    or limited lung capacity when put on ventilators.
                                </p>

                                <h3>WHAT MIGHT THEY NEED?</h3>
                                <p> All parents in our research group agreed that some kind of application was ideal for
                                    keeping on top of things both in and out of the home. As they, and their children,
                                    used smart devices regularly it made sense to go to where they already are. We
                                    needed to ensure that whatever we built was cross-platform and worked across a
                                    wide-range of devices due to the need to deliver across many countries worldwide.

                                 <p> Following research and sharing of paper prototypes, we found the sweet spot for the
                                     child and parent/carer’s needs was to have sections for the following:
                                     <ul>
                                        <li>Dashboard (for showing key child statistics)</li>
                                        <li>Schedule (with pre- and post-appointment reminders/notes)</li>
                                        <li>Emergency care considerations (for A&E situations)</li>
                                        <li>Medication (for reminders and accurate dosing)</li>
                                        <li>Help (for frequently asked questions, delivered as a sql-based chat bot)</li>
                                     </ul>
                                <h4>Platform</h4>
                                <p>In order to deliver something scalable and cross-platform we opted for an app that
                                     we could deploy through Appcelerator. This meant we needed to focus on JavaScript
                                     as our main language of choice and use JSON and XML to handle language
                                     translations.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Rollout</h4>
                                <p>Duchenne and Me is currently live in 3 countries; the UK, Germany and Turkey, and
                                     is due to go live in several other countries in the coming months. Reception so far
                                     has been excellent and app retention remains at around 83%.

                        <p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due to a

                        <p> Resources for parents and healthcare professionals are hard to come by when it comes to rare
                            disease and our client saw a need for providing a wealth of information to both audiences.

                        <h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
                        <p> One of the biggest factors we were made aware of through parent interviews was the rarity of
                            the disease and the likelihood that a child didn’t have Duchenne. The worry, is that it’s
                            easy as a frightened parent of a young child displaying normal symptoms of slow development
                            to see Duchenne as a possible answer and be terrified at seeing their child will die young.
                            This potential scaremongering is something our client wished to avoid at all costs.
                        </p>
                        <p> Healthcare professionals on the other hand struggled with a lack of high-science information
                            for them to read and understand. A GP will likely never see a case in their lifetime but if
                            they did, they’d need ample resource to help them.

                            HCP-friendly information on it. It needed to focus heavily on showing only the most
                            important and relevant information to someone when they needed it.

                            bullet points and section footers that encouraged moving to the next section when they’d
                            read the whole site (thus confirming the content was still relevant).

                            <p> The disease can be spotted by any of 6 different specialist doctors depending on what
                                symptoms a patient is presenting with. Because of this, different markets have been
                                targeting different specialists with their branded and unbranded materials to raise
                                awareness of the disease. The challenge was that each market was focussed in different
                                areas and therefore it was hard to measure global progress. Some of these specialities
                                were easier to target than others, so there were quick wins being missed by several
                                markets. Our client needed a tool to help solve this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The other major challenge was that the assessments used to measure success were being
                                kept in multiple Excel spreadsheets that weren’t centralised or easily locatable.
                            </p>

                            <p> Our core stakeholders all had laptops and smartphones provided by the company, some also
                                had iPads if their role was in sales. The challenge was that this tool would require
                                updating in many scenarios, so whatever the tool was, it needed to be multi-device and
                                fully scalable.

                            <p> We built a progressive web app that was fully scalable. It allowed the client to access
                                the content at any location, on any of the three devices they’d want to. It was also
                                vitally important that they could fill out the assessments without resorting to using
                                another platform or software, so we built the tool to use a sql database to capture the
                                answers and this allowed us to build algorithms to measure success based on baseline
                                metrics and provide insights to the users on possible next steps.

                            <h3>WHO WAS IT FOR?</h3>
                            <p> Duchenne is an extremely rare condition affecting around 1 in 3,500 children. It is due
                                to a
                                defective chromosome that stops proteins from being created correctly. As a result,
                                muscle
                                tissue turns to fat and often the child only lives until their mid-20’s. These
                                children, due to their
                                restrictions, are often very computer savvy and tend to love playing video games and
                                using
                                computers.
                            </p>

                            <p> The other side of the coin is the parents and carers of these children. Although not
                                directly
                                affected by the condition, they are tasked with managing the day to day condition for
                                the child
                                and tend to struggle to do so.

                            <h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
                            <p> From research we conducted with parents and carers, we found overwhelmingly that
                                100% of them struggled to remember to track vital statistics about their child
                                (growth, weight gain, activity levels) and remember to provide them with the correct
                                doses of their medications at the right times (often the mid-day dose was most
                                challenging to remember). Secondly, they struggle in emergency situations such as
                                visiting A&E. The condition is so rare that most emergency staff never see a case
                                and as such aren’t aware of specific difficulties such as easy fracturing of bones
                                or limited lung capacity when put on ventilators.

                            <p> All parents in our research group agreed that some kind of application was ideal for
                                keeping on top of things both in and out of the home. As they, and their children,
                                used smart devices regularly it made sense to go to where they already are. We
                                needed to ensure that whatever we built was cross-platform and worked across a
                                wide-range of devices due to the need to deliver across many countries worldwide.

                            <p> Following research and sharing of paper prototypes, we found the sweet spot for the
                                child and parent/carer’s needs was to have sections for the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dashboard (for showing key child statistics)</li>
                                    <li>Schedule (with pre- and post-appointment reminders/notes)</li>
                                    <li>Emergency care considerations (for A&E situations)</li>
                                    <li>Medication (for reminders and accurate dosing)</li>

                                <p>In order to deliver something scalable and cross-platform we opted for an app that
                                    we could deploy through Appcelerator. This meant we needed to focus on JavaScript
                                    as our main language of choice and use JSON and XML to handle language
                                    translations.
                                </p>
