						<h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p>
							The Fabry Disease website started because our client was unhappy with their pre-existing
							website which was not performing well. User numbers were low and content engagement was
							poor. They wanted us to completely rethink the layout, add some extra content and ensure
							that the final website offered a unique character.
						</p>
						<h4>My role</h4>
						<p>I was involved in every aspect of the Fabry Disease website, from conception of the overall
							approach, to performing stakeholder interviews and creating wireframes, prototypes and
							working with the senior designer and lead developer to identify accessibility improvemnt
							opportunities and ways to create unique interface paradigms for a healthcare website.
						</p>
						<p>My role consisted of the following:</p>
						<ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
							<li>Research based on Google Analytics</li>
							<li>Creation of simple user journey diagram based on initial research (we were not permitted
								to complete end-user
								research)</li>
							<li>Development of information architecture and liaison with content team on sitemap</li>
							<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype</li>
							<li>Collaboration with design team on interaction design</li>
							<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
							<li>Liaison with client IT support on server spec*</li>
						</ul>

						<p style="font-size:.75em;">
							*The client's server is a poor spec despite our support, so please ignore the site's speed
							(this is an
							ongoing struggle!)
						</p>

						<section aria-label="summary" class="wide" style="padding-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 20px;">
							<h4>Summary (the TL;DR version)</h4>
							<p>
								Our client felt their existing website was outdated and offered very little useful
								information as well as being built on an existing Wordpress framework that they were
								unwilling to continue to support due to unfounded security fears.
							</p>
							<p>
								We spent time evaluating the true concept behind what Fabrydisease.info could be and we
								landed on the importance of family as this is an inherited condition. The client also
								frequently uses the analogy of a family tree which we interpreted two-fold. One
								involving use of an image of a large family to provide the jumping off point of the
								website with members of the family representing each respective section. Secondly, the
								navigation on secondary pages used a timeline feel by providing icons along the
								right-hand side on desktop, alluding to the idea of a connected tree of information.
							</p>
							<p>
								We had to build the entire site using static HTML, CSS and JS in order for our client's
								IT team to be willing to support it for future rollouts. This meant that we ended up
								having to serve up content in a less than ideal way, but ultimately it appeased their
								requirements.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is currently live as a global website and can be accessed from anywhere. It is in
								the process of being widely localised by local countries.

							<h3>Who was it for?</h3>
							<p> Patients with Fabry disease
							</p>
							<h3>What challenges did they have?</h3>
							<p> Fabry disease is another tricky rare disease. Fabry fundamentally presents with very
								similar symtpoms to the
								common cold and in later development, conditions such as cardiomyopathy and renal
								failure. Due to this,
								patients are often left undiagnosed and this can lead to greater risk of their children
								having the condition
								without knowledge. If a patient is diagnosed, the likelihood of living a longer life is
								greatly increased and
								quality of life is vastly improved.
							</p>
							<h3>What might they need?</h3>
							<p> Our client had a pre-existing website that offered basic information about Fabry but was
								outdated and
								underutilised. We were asked to review the existing platform from a technical and
								analytical point of view and provide potential new approaches or enhancements.
							</p>
							<p> We discovered the following in our assessment:
								<ul class="list-display list-cross">
									<li>The website did not cater for mobile users and loaded the desktop interface by
										default</li>
									<li>The content was vague and unhelpful, often providing a single sentence for some
										content sections</li>
									<li>The interface was built on a standard Wordpress template and offered little
										branding</li>
									<li>It was hard to navigate to key sections so Google Analytics showed poor numbers
										beyond the homepage</li>
								</ul>

						<h3>What did we do?</h3>
						<p> We started from the ground up. We completely rethought the site's information architecture
							and created a brand new content plan and sitemap to suit the needs of the audience. We
							focused on better surfacing the information that was timely and relevant to the user, whilst
							providing some greater depth of insight and information.
						</p>
						<p> When it came to the UI, we thought about the importance of the 'family tree' aspect of Fabry
							disease and focused in on the idea of family. This led to the use of a family throughout the
							website's visual design and gave us the idea for the homepage navigation style. The home
							page is built on top of a mapping API that allows us to reskin Google Maps so we can have a
							pannable image with target hotspots for nav elements (on desktop only).
						</p>
						<h4>Platform</h4>
						<p> HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
						</p>
						<h4>Rollout</h4>
						<p> This tool is a global tool for all audience and is in the process of being rolled out and
							translated by local markets.
