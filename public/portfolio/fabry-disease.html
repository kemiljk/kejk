							<h3>WHAT IS IT?</h3>
							<p>
								The Fabry Disease website started because our client was unhappy with their pre-existing website which was not performing well. User numbers were low and content engagement was poor. They wanted us to completely rethink the layout, add some extra content and ensure that the final website offered a unique character.
							</p>
							<h4>My role</h4>
							<p>I was involved in every aspect of the Fabry Disease website, from conception of the overall
								approach, to performing stakeholder interviews and creating wireframes, prototypes and working with the senior designer and lead developer to identify accessibility improvemnt opportunities and ways to create unique interface paradigms for a healthcare website.
							</p>
							<p>My role consisted of the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Research based on Google Analytics</li>
							<li>Creation of simple user journey diagram based on initial research (we were not permitted to complete end-user
								research</li>
							<li>Development of information architecture and liaison with content team on sitemap</li>
							<li>Creation of high-fidelity wireframes and prototype</li>
							<li>Collaboration with design team on interface and interaction design</li>
							<li>Provision of files and functional spec to development</li>
							<li>Liaison with client IT support on server spec*</li>
						</ul>

						<p style="font-size:.75em;">
							*P.s. the client's server is a poor spec despite our support, so please ignore the site's speed (this is an
							ongoing struggle!)
						</p>
					<section aria-label="content">
						<h3>WHO WAS IT FOR?</h3>
						<p> Patients with Fabry disease
						</p>
						<h3>WHAT CHALLENGES DID THEY HAVE?</h3>
						<p> Fabry disease is another tricky rare disease. Fabry fundamentally presents with very similar symtpoms to the
							common cold and in later development, conditions such as cardiomyopathy and renal failure. Due to this,
							patients are often left undiagnosed and this can lead to greater risk of their children having the condition
							without knowledge. If a patient is diagnosed, the likelihood of living a longer life is greatly increased and
							quality of life is vastly improved.
						</p>
						<h3>WHAT MIGHT THEY NEED?</h3>
						<p> Our client had a pre-existing website that offered basic information about Fabry but was outdated and
							underutilised. We were asked to review the existing platform from a technical and analytical point of view and provide potential new approaches or enhancements.
						</p>
						<p> We discovered the following in our assessment:
							<ul>
								<li>The website did not cater for mobile users and loaded the desktop interface by default</li>
								<li>The content was vague and unhelpful, often providing a single sentence for some content sections</li>
								<li>The interface was built on a standard Wordpress template and offered little branding</li>
								<li>It was hard to navigate to key sections so Google Analytics showed poor numbers beyond the homepage</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>WHAT DID WE DO?</h3>
						<p> We started from the ground up. We completely rethought the site's information architecture and created a brand new content plan and sitemap to suit the needs of the audience. We focused on better surfacing the information that was timely and relevant to the user, whilst providing some greater depth of insight and information.
						</p>
						<p> When it came to the UI, we thought about the importance of the 'family tree' aspect of Fabry disease and focused in on the idea of family. This led to the use of a family throughout the website's visual design and gave us the idea for the homepage navigation style. The home page is built on top of a mapping API that allows us to reskin Google Maps so we can have a pannable image with target hotspots for nav elements (on desktop only).
						</p>
						<h4>Platform</h4>
						<p> HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
						</p>
						<h4>Rollout</h4>
						<p> This tool is a global tool for all audience and is in the process of being rolled out and translated by local markets.
